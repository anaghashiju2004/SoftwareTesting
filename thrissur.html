<b>Thrissur, often referred to as the “Cultural Capital of Kerala,” is one of the most vibrant and historically rich districts in the Indian state of Kerala.

<h2><em><i><u>Historical Background:</u></i></em></h2>
<b>The name Thrissur is derived from “Thiru-Shiva-Perur,” which roughly translates to “The City with the Name of Lord Shiva.” The city has a long and illustrious history, dating back to ancient times. It was a center of learning and spirituality and later became an important political and commercial hub under different rulers including the Chera dynasty, Zamorins of Calicut, and the Kingdom of Cochin.<br>

In the 18th century, Shakthan Thampuran, the Maharaja of Cochin, made significant contributions to Thrissur’s development. He modernized administration, encouraged trade, and was instrumental in promoting the famous Thrissur Pooram festival.<br></b>
